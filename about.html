My name is Jan van der Vegt and I'm an addict. Every day I think about interesting machine learning problems and sometimes I come up with solutions. Next to machine learning, I also like to try and solve more traditional optimization problems and work on simulations. I mostly enjoy the combination of theory, implementation in Python and then using it in some project. Recently I have decided to invest a bit more time into structuring this process and documenting my findings in the form of this blog.

I'm currently graduating in a Master's in Business Analytics, I've been working for an airline for the past two years and before that I was a full time Magic: the Gathering streamer. Next to this, I'm also a big fan of a few different types of electronic music, Amsterdam and sports. If you have any question, don't hesitate to mail or Tweet at me!
