My name is Jan van der Vegt and I'm enthusiastic for a lot of topics regarding Machine Learning and other optimization mathematics. I mostly enjoy the combination of theory, implementation in Python and then using it in some project. Recently I have decided to invest a bit more time into structuring this process and documenting my findings in the form of this blog.
